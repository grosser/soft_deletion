Explicit soft deletion for ActiveRecord via deleted_at + callbacks and optional default scope.<br/>
Not overwriting destroy or delete.

Install
=======

```Bash
gem install soft_deletion
```

Usage
=====

```Ruby
require 'soft_deletion'

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_soft_deletion default_scope: true

  before_soft_delete :validate_deletability # soft_delete stops if this returns false
  after_soft_delete :send_deletion_emails

  has_many :products
end

# soft delete them including all soft-deletable dependencies that are marked as :destroy, :delete_all, :nullify
user = User.first
user.products.count == 10
user.soft_delete!(validate: false)
user.deleted? # true

# use special with_deleted scope to find them ...
user.reload # ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
User.with_deleted do
  user.reload # there it is ...
  user.products.count == 0
end

# Do NOT use on assocations: Account.first.users.with_deleted {

# soft undelete them all
user.soft_undelete!
user.products.count == 10

# soft delete many
User.soft_delete_all!(1,2,3,4)

# get soft deleted records
User.soft_deleted
```

To add the `deleted_at` to your model, you can either generate a migration using:

```
rails generate migration add_deleted_at_to_users deleted_at:datetime:index
```

or create a migration file yourself like:

```Ruby
class AddDeletedAtToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_column :users, :deleted_at, :datetime
    add_index :users, :deleted_at
  end
end
```

By default `soft_deletion` does not change the `updated_at` value in the record. If you need this feature, you can use the `update_timestamp` option, passing the name of the column holding the timestamp to be updated, like, for example, `updated_at`:

```Ruby
require 'soft_deletion'

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_soft_deletion update_timestamp: :updated_at
end
```


TODO
====
 - has_many :through should delete join associations on soft_delete
 - cascading soft_deletes should use the same timestamp for easy reverts
